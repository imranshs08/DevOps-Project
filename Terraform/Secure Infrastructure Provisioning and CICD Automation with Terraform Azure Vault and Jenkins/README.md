#Secure Infrastructure Provisioning and CI/CD Automation with Terraform, Azure Vault, and Jenkins

# Project Overview:
```
Provision Azure infrastructure using Terraform.
Integrate Azure Vault for managing secrets.
Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins for a sample application deployment.
```
# Prerequisites:

- Azure subscription.
- Azure Vault instance.
- Jenkins server installed and configured.
- Terraform installed locally or on a CI/CD agent.

# Project Steps:

- Setup Terraform Environment:
*  Install Terraform.
*  Initialize a new Terraform project.

Define Azure Infrastructure:

Create a Terraform configuration file (main.tf) to define Azure resources like Virtual Networks, Subnets, VMs, etc.
Utilize Azure provider in Terraform to interact with Azure services.
Use Terraform modules to organize and reuse infrastructure components efficiently.
Integrate Azure Vault:

Install Azure Vault agent on VMs provisioned through Terraform.
Authenticate Azure VMs with Azure Vault.
Store sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, etc., securely in Azure Vault.
Sample Application Setup:

Prepare a sample application (could be a web app, API, or any other service) along with necessary configurations.
Store application configuration settings in Azure Vault.
Configure Jenkins:

Install necessary plugins in Jenkins for Azure integration and Terraform.
Configure Jenkins credentials to access Azure and Azure Vault securely.
Create a Jenkins pipeline to orchestrate the CI/CD process.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Define stages in Jenkins pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application.
Utilize Terraform commands within the pipeline to apply infrastructure changes.
Inject Azure Vault secrets securely into the application deployment process.
Testing and Deployment:

Implement automated tests as part of the Jenkins pipeline to ensure the application's integrity.
Automate the deployment process using Terraform for infrastructure and Jenkins for application deployment.
Monitor deployment logs and alerts for any issues.
Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:

Implement monitoring solutions (e.g., Azure Monitor) to track infrastructure and application performance.
Analyze logs and metrics for continuous improvement.
Iterate on the CI/CD pipeline for enhancements and optimizations.
Note: This is a high-level overview. Each step requires detailed implementation and configuration. Additionally, ensure best practices for security, scalability, and reliability are followed throughout the project
